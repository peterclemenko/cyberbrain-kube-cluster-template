= Bootstrapping Services On-Prem

The bootstrapping services are listed in the order they must be deployed. These are core services that are required for the rest of the platform to function.

To get started, you will need to have a few things in place:

.Components

* A Kubernetes Cluster that has been instantiated
* Kustomize
* Helm
* SOPS and KSOPS
** The AWS Decryption Key for SOPS/KSOPS

== Rendering the Kubernetes Manifests

Utilizing `Kustomize`, `Helm`, and `KSOPS`, you can render the Kubernetes manifests for the services we want to deploy. 

[source,bash]
----
./setup build
----

Once you confirm that the manifests have been rendered correctly, you can deploy them to your Kubernetes cluster.

[source,bash]
----
./setup apply
----
