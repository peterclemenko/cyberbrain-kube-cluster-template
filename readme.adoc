= Dan Manners' Homelab

____
All of the readme's are in a state of flux at this moment.
I'm working on refactoring much of the repository, but I'm happy to answer any questions in the https://discord.gg/k8s-at-home[k8s@Home Discord server] or on Discord!
Feel free to reach me at `danmanners` with any questions or at link:mailto:daniel.a.manners@gmail.com[daniel.a.manners@gmail.com]!

This homelab repository is aimed at applying widely-accepted tools and established practices within the DevOps/SRE world. Its primary objectives are to efficiently carry out the intended service functions while also serving as a valuable reference for individuals looking to enhance their own learning. This repository is not intended to be a "one-size-fits-all" solution, but rather a starting point for others to build upon and learn from.

== Deployment Order of Operations



== To-Do Items

* Ensure that *ALL* services are tagged for the appropriate hardware (`arm64` or `amd64`) to ensure runtime success
 ** Alternatively, ensure that all containers are built for multi-architecture.
* Ensure that *ALL* application and service subdirectories have READMEs explaining what they're doing and what someone else may need to modify for their own environment

== Gratitude and Thanks

This README redesign was inspired by several other homelab repos, individuals, and communities.

Without the inspiration and help of these individuals and communities, I don't think my own project would be nearly as far.
Make sure to check out their projects as well!
