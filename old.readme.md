# Dan Manners' Homelab

> All of the readme's are in a state of flux at this moment. I'm working on refactoring much of the repository, but I'm happy to answer any questions in the [k8s@Home Discord server](https://discord.gg/k8s-at-home) or on Discord! Feel free to reach me at `danmanners` with any questions or at [daniel.a.manners@gmail.com](mailto:daniel.a.manners@gmail.com)!

## Deployment Order of Operations

## Identifying Problems, Troubleshooting Steps, and more

Below are a few things that may be beneficial to you when troubleshooting or getting things up and operational

### Traffic is not getting from the edge (cloud) nodes to the on-prem cluster networking

You can validate that your remote traffic is or isn't making it on site by using `dig` inside of the [netshoot container]()

```bash
kubectl run temp-troubleshooting \
  --rm -it -n default \
  --overrides='{"apiVersion":"v1","spec":{"nodeSelector":{"kubernetes.io/hostname":"talos-aws-grav01"}}}' \
  --pod-running-timeout 3m \
  --image=docker.io/nicolaka/netshoot:latest \
  --command -- /bin/bash
```

Then, you can validate that you can reach CoreDNS or another pod/service IP from your remote node.

If you can prove it is not working, you may want to restart all of Cilium:

```bash
kubectl rollout restart -n kube-system daemonset cilium
```

## To-Do Items

- Ensure that **ALL** services are tagged for the appropriate hardware (`arm64` or `amd64`) to ensure runtime success
  - Alternatively, ensure that all containers are built for multi-architecture.
- Ensure that **ALL** application and service subdirectories have READMEs explaining what they're doing and what someone else may need to modify for their own environment

## Gratitude and Thanks

This README redesign was inspired by several other homelab repos, individuals, and communities.

Without the inspiration and help of these individuals and communities, I don't think my own project would be nearly as far. Make sure to check out their projects as well!
